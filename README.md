# Leetcode-1372.-Longest-ZigZag-Path-in-a-Binary-Tree
# 🔀 Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree 🌳

Are you ready to dance through your binary tree in a zigzag? 💃🕺  
This project finds the **longest ZigZag path** in a binary tree — alternating between left and right child nodes — with a clever and recursive approach.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

This solution:
- Traverses the tree recursively
- Switches direction at each level to create a ZigZag 🌀
- Keeps track of the longest valid ZigZag path

The path doesn't have to start at the root — it can begin at any node and end at any leaf. 🧠🌿

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity

| Operation             | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Full ZigZag Search 🔀| O(n)             | O(h)             |

- **n** = total number of nodes  
- **h** = height of the tree (stack space for recursion)
